This should be installed on a CLEAN Raspberry Pi OS Lite 32-bit (debian Bullseye).  This is only tested on a Pi4 with a NAD Amp and a Chord Mojo 2 - both over USB.  The headphones and HDMI outputs are disabled in the install script.


**To Install :**

git clone https://github.com/robsterooni/tidal && sudo ./tidal/install.sh
